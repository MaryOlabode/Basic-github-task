I recently made a life changing decision to switch to Tech after about 5 years of being in the teaching profession. I would say that it's a very big and bold step for me. I newly started a career path in Software Testing/ Quality Assurance Engineering. I am now a Software Tester/Quality Assurance Engineer. I am proficient in manual software testing. I can create test plan, write test cases, write bug reports and test summary report efficiently. I am a very determined person. my favorite driving quote is "When there is a will, there is a way". I look forward to doing great things and breaking grounds in the Tech world.
